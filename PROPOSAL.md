# Brick Breaker

## Intro
For my project I want to make [Brick Breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Breaker) game.

My final goal is to be able to play a full game along with power-ups and a leader-board.

The reason I chose the game 'Brick Breaker' is because it was one of my favorite games growing up, and I wanted to try
and create the game based on the current coding skills that I have.

### External Libraries
I will be using [CinderBlocks](https://libcinder.org/docs/guides/cinder-blocks/index.html) as well as an
[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) library to make the leader-board.
- The CinderBlocks I will be using are [ciAnimatedGif](https://github.com/cwhitney/ciAnimatedGif) and
[Cinder-SoundPlayer](https://github.com/redpaperheart/Cinder-SoundPlayer).
- I will be using [SqliteModernCpp](https://github.com/SqliteModernCpp/sqlite_modern_cpp) to communicate with the
database

As of week 1, I would like to set up the library and figure out the CMake files. I want to be able to use the libraries 
and make sure they work. 

By week 2, I would want to make a bare-bones working version of the full game (only the game aspect). If I have time, I
will add all the textures to my game this week, otherwise I'll do that during the start of *Week 3*.

During the 3rd and final week, I want to implement the leader-board and the power-ups (extensions) so that my game
is fully functional and ready for presenting.
